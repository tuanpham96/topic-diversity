    \textit{Summary  of  population  and  individual  diversity  indices  due  to $\alpha$,  across  different  block  models}. Within each heatmap, x-axis shows decreasing modularity of intralayer model (via increasing inter-modular connectivity), y-axis is $\alpha$. The color represents values at the end of the simulations, and min-max normalized within each metric. From left to right are different diversity metrics. From top to bottom are different group correspondence initialization strategies.
